# Kenjutsu Comment CLI

A command-line tool (`kjc`) for retrieving inline diff comments attached to jj changes.
Designed primarily for consumption by AI agents — it outputs structured JSON with
file paths, line numbers, comment bodies, and surrounding source context so that
agents can understand and act on review feedback.

## Features

- **Agent-friendly JSON** — Structured output with file paths, line numbers, context, and threading that agents can parse directly
- **Auto-detection** — Automatically detects the change ID from your jj working copy
- **File filtering** — Narrow results to a specific file
- **Resolved/unresolved** — Shows only unresolved comments by default; use `--all` to include resolved ones
- **Context lines** — Each comment includes surrounding source lines so agents can locate and understand the code being discussed
- **Comment status** — Quick overview of unresolved/resolved comment counts per change

## Prerequisites

- [Jujutsu](https://martinvonz.github.io/jj/) (`jj` CLI, v0.38+)

## Installation

Download a binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/Yuki-bun/kenjutsu/releases) (look for `kjc/v*` tags) and place it on your `PATH`:

```bash
VERSION=0.1.0

# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -LO "https://github.com/Yuki-bun/kenjutsu/releases/download/kjc/v${VERSION}/kjc-aarch64-darwin"
chmod +x kjc-aarch64-darwin
sudo mv kjc-aarch64-darwin /usr/local/bin/kjc

# Linux (x86_64)

### From source

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Yuki-bun/kenjutsu.git
cd kenjutsu
cargo install --path src-cli
```

## Usage

`kjc` has two subcommands: `get` and `status`.

### `kjc get` — Retrieve comments

```bash
# Show unresolved comments for the current working copy change
kjc get

# Specify a change ID explicitly
kjc get -c ksrmyxvnwqpqrqxpvrts

# Filter to a specific file
kjc get -f src/main.rs

# Include resolved comments too
kjc get -a
```

#### Flags

| ------------------ | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `--change-id <id>` | `-c`  | Full-length jj change ID (auto-detected if omitted)  |
| `--file <path>`    | `-f`  | Filter to a specific file                            |
| `--all`            | `-a`  | Include resolved comments (default: unresolved only) |

### `kjc status` — Show comment counts

```bash
# Comment counts for the default revset
kjc status

# Comment counts for a specific revset
kjc status "trunk()..@"

# Include changes with no unresolved comments
kjc status -a
```
